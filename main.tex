\chapter{Introduction}

Handwritten signatures are one of the ubiquitous ways to ensure trust, in the case that a contract is sealed between parties. However, they present various logistical and security shortcomings. For instance, individuals are advised to be physically present to sign any documents, for they cannot be truthfully identified otherwise. Additionally, this kind of personal calligraphy can be forged with little effort. A solution coherent with the rise of the Information Age is found within mathematical frameworks known as signature schemes, that enable explicit assertions on the security of signatures.

A vibrant discipline of public-key cryptography, signature schemes are often associated with digital systems, in which transit of sensitive messages is expected to be secure. However, a specific scheme used within this situation drastically alters matters of security and performance compared to others. This is due to their natural connection to hard computational problems, that prevent forgery of signatures in various threat models. It is thus known that advances in computer engineering present direct consequences on the development of signature schemes.

Classical computers are electronic in nature, using circuits to perform computations. However, a new paradigm has emerged in the form of quantum computers, in which computations are performed outside the scope of classical mechanics. Although these computers are physically hard to implement, algorithms that make use of quantum phenomena have already been proposed and provably present a speedup compared to classical computers. One of these algorithms, due to Shor~\cite{}, simplifies the complexity of integer factorisation, and can be theoretically used to break widely used signature schemes.

Post-quantum cryptography addresses this issue by defining signature schemes which are either not known to be affected by quantum computers, or provably so~\cite{}. A popular technique employed to build quantum-resistant signatures is the usage of systems of equations over finite fields with multiple variables within the algorithms that rule the scheme. Primitives that use this strategy collectively define the area of multivariate cryptography.

\chapter{Chronology}

In this chapter, we outline the dates for special occasions that lead altogether to the conclusion of a postgraduate qualification, namely a Master of Science degree, by the author. In no specific order, these consist of assorted activities related to the underlying program:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \setlength\itemsep{1pt}
  \item\label{enum:0} defense of the studies conducted over the qualification period;
  \item\label{enum:1} writing a master's thesis;
  \item\label{enum:2} the acceptance of a scientific paper by an academic conference or journal;
  \item\label{enum:3} a minimum of credits from a given curriculum;
  \item\label{enum:4} a qualification exam;
  \item\label{enum:5} an English proficiency exam;
  \item\label{enum:6} attendance in events promoted by the program. 
\end{enumerate}

Most of these events are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:1}. We highlight at least two paper submissions to conferences, but only the most relevant dates are presented to prevent visual pollution. Furthermore, items~\ref{enum:3} and~\ref{enum:6} are to be completed until the execution of item~\ref{enum:4}, and are not pictured due to the high distribution of dates related to these activities. We expect that items~\ref{enum:2} to~\ref{enum:6} are finished within the first year of the degree, and the remaining items on the second year.
