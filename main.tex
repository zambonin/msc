\section{Related work}\label{sec:related}

In this section, we make use of the previously well-defined boundaries with regards to the scope of our work in order to perform the necessary search in the literature. We recall that our main object of study are digital signature schemes which make use of Oil--Vinegar polynomials in their construction. More precisely, it is known that key sizes for instantiations of such schemes are currently impra

In this section, we describe the research strategy applied to produce this work. Recall that the objects of study are the key sizes of Rainbow-like signature schemes. We define the main research question, parse the related body of literature, and finally apply several reproducible methods in order to infer conclusions. Indeed, this is essentially a description of the usual scientific method. In other words, we infer knowledge from mensurable experiments related to deductions, in the interest of solving specific limitations that come with the hypothesis.

We inspect formal works such as journal and conference articles, and monographs. We restrict ourselves to works published exactly after the first formal description of Rainbow~\cite{Ding:200506:inproc}, and particularly select ones that deal with reduction of key sizes. To conduct this analysis, the Google Scholar web tool was employed. It is a meta-indexer that covers most scientific literature providers, and allows the user to input advanced parameters in order to correctly narrow the needed scope.

The exact query used is \texttt{rainbow AND signature AND crypto AND (scheme OR post-quantum OR cryptography)}, searched over publications in English, no older than 2005, and not including patents. It is important to note that the keywords are searched over the entirety of the paper, whenever available. The query aims to reduce the amount of noise generated by the common name of the scheme, and as such, returns $\approx 1{,}150$ results. 

This is close to the number of works obtained when grouping all analogous searches in other sites, such as the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Semantic Scholar and Springer Link. Indeed, Google Scholar additionally crawls other sources, \emph{e.g.} university and governmental repositories, and as such returns a slightly larger number of works. From this set, we select relevant papers and present a summary below.

Schemes based on multivariate cryptography with modifications that enable the
reduction of private key sizes have been suggested even before Rainbow was
created. Tame transformation schemes, such as the ones listed
in~\cite{Wolf:200503:misc}, feature sparseness in their maps, a common
strategy used to shorten private keys, as seen in~\cite{Yang:200604:inproc}.
However, these schemes were either broken, as summarised
in~\cite{Ding:200604:article}, or in the case of Enhanced TTS, new parameters
were suggested, and it was subsequently found to be a special case of
Rainbow~\cite{Thomae:201207:inproc}.

Additionally, there are several published variations of Rainbow with the
same goal, making use of distinct approaches. A scheme called
Lite-Rainbow-0~\cite{Shim:201512:inproc} employs a small pseudorandom
number generator (PRNG) seed to replace the private key entirely. This shortens
the private key by a factor of approximately $99.8\%$, but greatly increases
the cost for signature generation. NC-Rainbow was proposed
in~\cite{Yasuda:201202:inproc}, with a novel strategy based in non-commutative
rings to reduce a private key by up to $75\%$. However, it was shown by
independent researchers to be
insecure~\cite{Thomae:201209:inproc,Hashimoto:201302:inproc}. Other variants
called MB-Rainbow~\cite{Yasuda:201305:inproc} and
NT-Rainbow~\cite{Yasuda:201404:inproc} employ sparseness of maps to reduce the
number of terms in the private key by up to $40\%$.

The authors merged MB- and NC-Rainbow into a single scheme called
MNT-Rainbow~\cite{Yasuda:201409:article}, shortening private keys by up to
$76\%$. Nevertheless, the original schemes were deemed insecure and new
parameters were suggested in~\cite{Peng:201706:article}. It also proposes a new
scheme called Circulant Rainbow, which reduces the private key by up to $45\%$
due to the concept of rotating relations. Yet, it was broken shortly
after~\cite{Hashimoto:201810:misc}. Furthermore, it appears that the introduction
of structures in the private key is highly threatening to the overall security 
of a Rainbow scheme.

In the case of modifications to the public key, there are mainly two approaches.
The approach by the authors of~\cite{Petzoldt:201006:inproc} is, to the best of 
our knowledge, the main method for public key reduction without compromises to
the signature size. It explores the fact that specific parts of the public key
do not contribute to the security of the scheme. It is summarised in several
publications~\cite{Petzoldt:201012:inproc,Petzoldt:201103:inproc,Petzoldt:201211:inproc,Petzoldt:201307:phd}
and used in~\cite{Shim:201512:inproc} to construct Lite-Rainbow-1.

The authors of~\cite{Szepieniec:201706:inproc} lift the public and central maps
of a particular case of Rainbow to an extension field, reducing its public 
key size by an order of magnitude but increasing the signature size. This is 
compatible with the generalised scheme, as seen in~\cite{Beullens:201706:msc,Beullens:201712:inproc},
and can make use of the improvements to the public key given above. However,
both of these strategies cannot be combined with the private key improvements
previously cited. 

\emph{Hypothesis.} It follows from the analysis above that, to the best of our knowledge, no works in the literature attempt to reduce both private and public keys in Rainbow-like signature schemes. This is due to the intricate relationship between both keys, in which one is used to create the other. Therefore, our hypothesis is answered positively if a scheme description is uncovered that shortens both keys in the key pair.

\subsection{Research method}

We enumerate below a chronological list of activities that depict the process used to develop our research.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*), itemsep=1pt]
    \item Maintain a bibliography featuring works related to reduction of keys in Rainbow-like signature schemes;
    \item Classify strategies used by scheme variants to reduce private or public keys;
    \item Develop a strategy to modify keys that is independent from existing ones;
    \item Test the scheme derived from this strategy against known cryptanalytic methods, particularly ones that take advantage of concepts used to devise this variant;
    \item Measure the overall gains of the scheme with regards to key sizes, comparing the new variant with existing works;
    \item Provide a reference implementation to show that our proposal does not deviate from default inputs and outputs.
\end{enumerate}
